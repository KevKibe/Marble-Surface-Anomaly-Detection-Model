# Problem Statement
This is a Computer Vision task that uses a CNN model to classify images of models as either defective or good.<br> This model can be used in industries that manufacture marble tops for the purpose of quality control.<br> Furthermore the model is lightweight and requires a considerably small amount of computing resources making it efficient for use in embedded systems.    
# Dataset
The data used to train the model is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardaddy24/marble-surface-anomaly-detection.
